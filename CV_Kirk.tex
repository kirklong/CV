\section{Research Interests}
%%default: long version
 I am broadly excited about employing advances in modern computing to analyze large data-sets and to simulate interesting systems numerically\textemdash currently I'm enjoying matching novel models of the broad-line region to interferometric data taken with the GRAVITY instrument on the VLTI.

      & a disk-wind launching model could provide an alternate explanation for the \\
      & observed properties of broad-line emission in quasars. We compare our models with \\
      & observations of quasar 3C273 using the unparalleled resolution of the interferometric \\
      & GRAVITY instrument on the VLTI, with potential implications for accepted black \\
      & hole mass and size measurements.\vspace{1mm}\\

      & Analyzed archival data from CHANDRA and XMM-Newton (with the help of \\
      & HEASoft and SAS) to attempt to find both new pulsars that may not have been\\
      & previously detected (through pairings that increased statistial significance) \\
      & and of pulsars whose periods had changed substantially (indicating potential \\
      & accretion from a binary companion).\\

\section{Extracurricular Activities}
I enjoy spending time outdoors (particularly hiking and skiing), tinkering with amateur science projects (I've built cloud chambers, homemade rockets and fireworks, DIY telescopes, a brick kiln for metallurgical experimentation, and more), and making and teaching music (I've partly financed my studies thus far working at a local studio). I particularly enjoy learning and performing classical piano works---the latest addition to my repertoire is Gershwin's \textit{Rhapsody in Blue} and my favorite piece is Rachmaninoff's \textit{Prelude in G Minor}.

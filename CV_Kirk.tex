\section{Research Interests}
%%default: long version
 I am enthralled by the advances in modern computing that have enabled us to analyze data-sets of enormous magnitudes as well as numerically simulate systems with an unprecedented level of detail. I enjoy analyzing interesting physics/astronomy problems from a computational perspective, and I am particularly fascinated by dense stellar objects and the processes that form them (including the various flavors of neutron stars) as well as the evolution of our universe and the systems in it. I have enjoyed combining these passions in my research thus far, which has focused on identifying accreting pulsars in x-ray binaries.

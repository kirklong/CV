\section{Research Interests}
%%default: long version
 I am excited about employing advances in modern computing to analyze large data-sets and to simulate interesting systems numerically. I am broadly fascinated with the evolution of our universe and its systems, and I have enjoyed combining these passions in my research thus far, which has focused on identifying accreting pulsars in x-ray binaries and the simulation of broadline emission from accretion disks surrounding quasars.

\section{Extracurricular Activities}
I enjoy spending time outdoors (particularly hiking and skiing), tinkering with amateur science projects (I've built cloud chambers, homemade rockets and fireworks, DIY telescopes, a brick kiln for metallurgical experimentation, and more), and making and teaching music (I've partly financed my studies thus far working at a local studio). I particularly enjoy learning and performing classical piano works---the latest addition to my repertoire is Gershwin's \textit{Rhapsody in Blue} and my favorite piece is Rachmaninoff's \textit{Prelude in G Minor}.
